description: "D912pxy is a tool that allows Guild Wars 2 to use DirectX 12 by translating calls for DirectX 9 to DirectX 12. The developer says: \n\n\"What to expect from this?
    More stable FPS in general - Higer FPS if you have free CPU and GPU power - Lower FPS if you have no extra CPU power / GPU power - Higher RAM and VRAM usage - 
    Using eGPU you can expect big improvements due to GPU-CPU bandwith optimization - Some visual bugs and most notable character portraits glitching\""
