# TODO

### Updating Addons

- version tracking for BuildPad
- Buildpad compatibility - scan folder for .dlls for filename

### UX

- If error occurs during one addonâ€™s install process, display an error message and print to log file, then continue the update process for the other addons
- clean install button
- display conflicts/dependencies
- button to select game path using file explorer instead of pasting it in manually

### Bugs

- Mechanics log and boontable not working for at least 2 users (see [discord channel](https://discord.gg/n2pCuCG))
