# TODO

### Updating Addons

- version tracking for BuildPad

### UX

- If error occurs during one addonâ€™s install process, display an error message and print to log file, then continue the update process for the other addons
- Toggle for send to recycle bin/permanently delete files

### Bugs

- Mechanics log and boontable not working for at least 2 users (see [discord channel](https://discord.gg/n2pCuCG))
