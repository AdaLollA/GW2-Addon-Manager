##### Guild Wars 2 Unofficial Add-On Manager
A tool to improve the experience of using addons and plugins in Guild Wars 2 by handling installation, updates, and file management behind the scenes.

### Project Status

Update 1.0.0 is nearing completion and will be releasing soon. A pre-release alpha **with no Arc-Bhud or Arc-Mechanics compatibility** is available on the [releases](https://github.com/fmmmlee/GW2-Addon-Manager/releases) page. Features include changing the configuration file to .yaml format, displaying addon descriptions and other information in a selection window, bug fixes, UI improvements, and a complete restructuring of the addon installation process to include and be compatible with the [addon loader](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader).
